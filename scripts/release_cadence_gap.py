"""release_cadence_gap.py — {AGET-Release_gap} SLO reading for R-REL-CAD-007.

R-REL-CAD-007 (POLICY_release_cadence v1.1.0+, D-RP-7) caps the release gap:
"no more than 3 consecutive Saturdays (~21 days) SHALL pass without a public
release." Until 2026-08-07 that cap had NO instrument — the requirement was
wired into a BLOCKING ceremony gate (sops/SOP_scope_lock_ceremony.md G1.VALUEGATE)
while nobody computed its bound. See docs/STUDY_slis_and_slo_candidates_2026-07-28.md
F5 and gh#1769.

SLI specification (per the shape established by release_time_slo.py, 2026-08-07):

  good/total shape : none — thresholdMetric (lte), not a ratio
  event            : one interval between consecutive public releases
  indicator        : count of Saturdays falling strictly between the two release
                     moments
  start boundary   : taggerdate of annotated tag v<N> in the CANONICAL public
                     repo (../aget)
  end boundary     : taggerdate of annotated tag v<N+1>, same repo
  objective        : saturdays_spanned <= 3
  timezone         : taggerdate is tz-aware; Saturday is evaluated in the tag's
                     own offset (a release is "on a Saturday" where it was cut)
  scope            : the cap binds only from 2026-06-26, when R-REL-CAD-007 was
                     introduced. Earlier intervals are reported as HISTORICAL
                     CONTEXT and are NOT breaches — the policy did not exist.

Why taggerdate and not creatordate: for a lightweight tag, creatordate is the
tagged commit's date, which is when the work happened, not when it went public.
Mixing the two silently blends two different boundaries into one series. This
instrument REFUSES lightweight tags rather than dating them from a commit.

Provenance discipline: the denominator is every annotated vX.Y.Z tag in the
canonical repo. A tag that cannot be dated from its own tag object is reported
as SKIPPED with its reason, never silently dropped.

Usage:
    release_cadence_gap.py [--repo PATH] [--cap N] [--all] [--json]

    --all includes pre-policy intervals, which are context and never breaches.
    --json emits the full interval series plus the skipped-tag disclosure.

Exit codes:
    0  cap HELD (or no binding intervals yet)
    1  cap BREACHED -- on every output path, --json included
    2  source UNAVAILABLE -- the declared repository was not measured

def _default_repo():
    """Resolve the canonical repo without assuming a fleet checkout layout.

    Was the bare literal "../aget". At the producing seat a sibling `aget/`
    exists and it worked; at a consumer -- a single clone with no fleet around
    it -- there is no sibling, so this exited 1 with "cannot read tags" and the
    instrument was dead on arrival. Measured 2026-08-15 by a downstream seat
    installing v3.31.0 from a clean clone.

    The same sibling-checkout assumption was fixed in a promoted TEST hours
    before that release shipped, and survived here. Fixing one instance of a
    class and shipping another instance of the same class is what makes this
    worth a comment rather than a one-word diff.

    Resolution order, first hit wins:
      1. AGET_CANONICAL_ROOT           -- explicit operator override
      2. this file's own repo root     -- the common case: we ARE canonical
      3. ../aget sibling               -- the fleet-checkout layout

    REPAIRED 2026-08-21 (v3.32 AC-3). The ladder above was correct; its FAILURE
    MODE was not. An explicit AGET_CANONICAL_ROOT that does not resolve fell
    silently through to rule 2 and the tool measured a DIFFERENT repository,
    reported it as the canonical public repo, and exited 0.

    Measured on the shipped blob 4ac6b576268b31d4ea580ea12293d7a8bbc95d1e:
      AGET_CANONICAL_ROOT=/nonexistent ... --json  ->  exit 0
      "source_repo": "<whatever repo the script happened to live in>"
      disclosure of the rejected input: none

    An operator who names a subject and is silently given another subject gets a
    confident answer about the wrong thing. That is worse than an error.

    Two rules, and they are different in kind:
      - An explicit input that does not resolve is UNAVAILABLE (exit 2). It is
        never silently replaced, and never conflated with FAIL (exit 1), which
        means "the subject was read and the cadence is breached."
      - Discovery (rules 2 and 3) applies only when NO explicit input was given.

    Returns (repo, strategy). The strategy is disclosed in output so a reader can
    always tell which rule won -- source disclosure, not just source selection.
