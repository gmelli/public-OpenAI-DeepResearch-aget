ground_artifact.py — Ontology binding GENERATOR (the "connect with ontology" feature).

The generate/suggest counterpart to the detect-only scripts/check_skill_grounding.py.
Where check_skill_grounding.py COUNTS existing inline aget:concept/X references and
flags 0-binding files, this script CONNECTS an artifact to the ontology: it scans a
target file for ontology prefLabels appearing as noun phrases and emits ranked,
copy-pasteable inline-binding suggestions the author can insert.

This closes the missing half of INIT-ONTOLOGY-SPEC-BINDING Stream 3 ("graduate to
Strict + auto-suggest", v3.19 success metric) and remediates the L924 binding gap:
classification without consequence stays decorative until something proposes the
binding, not merely measures its absence.

Concepts (this script binds to the ontology it operationalizes):
  - aget:concept/NormativeConceptBinding (C641) — the binding this script proposes
  - aget:concept/InlineUriReference       (C642) — the pattern it emits
  - aget:concept/SpecificationToOntologyBinding (C644) — the spec-layer target
  - aget:concept/BackwardLinking          (C649) — reciprocal-link reminder it prints
  - aget:concept/VocabularyDecorationFailure (C646) — the counter it remediates
  - aget:concept/BindOnceDecayOften       (C650) — the decay it helps re-bind

Usage:
  python3 scripts/ground_artifact.py --file <path>
  python3 scripts/ground_artifact.py --file aget/specs/SOME_SPEC.md --top 20

Exit codes:
  0  Ran successfully (suggestions printed, or none needed)

    altLabel was added 2026-08-08. It had been omitted since the tool was written,

    893 of 926 concepts (96%) carry altLabels, 1,857 in total, of which 1,801 pass

    term being coined for a concept that already exists, and a miss is SILENT:
    "no suggestions" reads identically to "no such concept," which licenses the
    coinage. Measured the day this was fixed: of four terms coined and then found
    to be duplicates, THREE were reachable only via altLabel (Scope-Blind PASS →
    C1771, Minimal Authority Default → C267, Default Path Reversal → C222). The
