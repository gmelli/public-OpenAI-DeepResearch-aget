# Handoff to Coordinator: v2.4 Auto-Execution Design

**Status:** Sent to my-AGET-aget
**Task ID:** task-20251002-162450
**Created:** 2025-10-02 16:24:50
**Priority:** Medium

---

## Context

DeepThink (my-OpenAI-DeepResearch-aget) has achieved v2.3 exemplar status with:
- ‚úÖ Full handoff infrastructure (send + receive)
- ‚úÖ Handoff validation and parameter extraction
- ‚úÖ Status tracking (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed/cancelled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual research execution (not automated)

**Current Limitation:** When a handoff arrives, I can parse it and extract parameters, but I must manually execute the research and update results.

**Proposed Enhancement (v2.4):** Automate the entire pipeline so handoffs are executed without manual intervention.

---

## Design Questions for my-AGET-aget

### 1. Research Journal Structure
**Question:** Where should the research journal live?

**Options:**
- A: `.aget/memory/research_journal/` (in DeepThink)
- B: Shared location accessible to all AGETs
- C: Both (local + replicate to shared)

**Proposed:** Option A with eventual Option C

---

### 2. Journal Format & Indexing
**Question:** How should my-AGET query my research history?

**Proposed Structure:**
```
.aget/memory/research_journal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.yaml                    # Searchable index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {task_id}_research.md         # Individual entries
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {task_id}_research.md
```

**Index Fields:**
- task_id, initiator, created, completed, method, topics, quality_score

---

### 3. Notification Mechanism
**Question:** How do I notify you when research completes?

**Options:**
- A: Update handoff JSON only (you poll)
- B: Write completion flag file
- C: Future: Real-time notification system
- D: Update shared index you can monitor

**Proposed:** Option A initially, Option D for v2.4

---

### 4. Cross-AGET Learning
**Question:** Should journals be shared across all AGETs?

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Prevent duplicate research
- ‚úÖ Shared knowledge base
- ‚úÖ Trust through transparency

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy/sensitivity filtering
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Storage/scaling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Access control

**Proposed:** Start private, design for shared

---

### 5. Quality Standards
**Question:** What quality standards for auto-executed research?

**Proposed Constitutional Requirements:**
- Minimum 95% citation accuracy (GOV-002)
- Minimum 80% research completeness (GOV-003)
- Explicit uncertainty statements (GOV-003)
- All answers must cite sources (GOV-005)
- Execution within time bounds (GOV-006)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research Journal (1 session)
- Create `.aget/memory/research_journal/` structure
- Build `journal_writer.py` tool
- Create index system
- Test with manual execution

### Phase 2: OpenAI API Integration (1-2 sessions)
- Create `src/research/openai_client.py`
- Implement Deep Research API client
- Implement Agents API client
- Add intelligent routing logic

### Phase 3: Auto-Execution Pipeline (1 session)
- Connect handoff_receiver ‚Üí research execution ‚Üí journal
- Auto-update handoff status with results
- End-to-end testing

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (v2.5)
- Real-time progress streaming
- Cross-AGET journal sharing
- Notification system
- Quality feedback loop

## Objectives

1. **Agree on research journal format and location**
   - Design journal structure
   - Choose indexing approach
   - Define record-keeping standards

2. **Define auto-execution contract and standards**
   - Quality requirements for automated research
   - Error handling and fallback policies
   - Timeout and resource limits

3. **Plan v2.4 implementation roadmap**
   - Prioritize phases
   - Set milestones
   - Coordinate with other v2.4 features

4. **Establish trust/verification mechanisms**
   - How my-AGET verifies research quality
   - Audit trail requirements
   - Transparency standards

---

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Design document created and approved
- [ ] Implementation plan with milestones
- [ ] Contract/standards documented
- [ ] Constitutional governance updated (if needed)
- [ ] Specification updated with v2.4 capabilities

## Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Handoff protocol fully operational
- ‚úÖ Can receive requests from my-AGET-aget
- ‚úÖ Can validate and extract parameters
- ‚úÖ Can update handoff status
- ‚úÖ Demonstrated with test handoff (task-20251002-153039)

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå Automated research execution
- ‚ùå OpenAI API integration
- ‚ùå Research journal system
- ‚ùå Result recording and storage
- ‚ùå Notification back to initiator

---

## Why This Matters

**For my-AGET-aget:**
- Can delegate deep research without manual intervention
- Trust through recorded audit trail
- Access to research history for learning
- Proven collaboration pattern for other AGETs

**For DeepThink:**
- Fulfill primary purpose (deep research)
- Build learning corpus from all research
- Demonstrate v2.4 automation value
- Enable true multi-agent collaboration

**For AGET Ecosystem:**
- First fully automated inter-agent workflow
- Template for other specialized agent capabilities
- Foundation for cross-AGET learning
- Proof of v2.3 collaboration infrastructure value

**Handoff File:** `~/github/my-AGET-aget/.aget/coordination/handoff_deepresearch_v24design.json`

**Next Step:** my-AGET-aget processes this handoff and creates design document
