capabilities:
  RP-001:
    domain: invocation
    statement: "WHEN user invokes `/aget-review-project`, the SKILL shall analyze project plan and report health."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: slash_command
    priority: critical
    outputs:
      - "Project review report"
      - "Health Status: OK | WARN | CRITICAL"
    verification: "Review report generated"

  RP-002:
    domain: location
    statement: "WHEN path argument provided, the SKILL shall analyze that specific project plan."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: path_arg
    priority: high
    verification: "Specified project analyzed"

  RP-003:
    domain: location
    statement: "WHEN no path provided, the SKILL shall search planning/PROJECT_PLAN_*.md for active projects."
    pattern: event-driven
    trigger: no_path
    priority: medium
    verification: "Active projects discovered"

  RP-004:
    domain: parsing
    statement: "The SKILL shall extract: metadata, gates, success criteria, and risks from project plan."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Parsed project structure"
    verification: "All sections extracted"

  RP-005:
    domain: evaluation
    statement: "The SKILL shall count V-tests and calculate completion percentage per gate."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "V-test counts per gate"
      - "Overall completion percentage"
    verification: "Counts accurate"

  RP-006:
    domain: blockers
    statement: "The SKILL shall identify failed V-tests, blocked items, and materialized risks."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: high
    outputs:
      - "Blockers list"
    verification: "Blockers identified"

  RP-007:
    domain: recommendations
    statement: "The SKILL shall generate actionable recommendations based on evaluation."
    pattern: ubiquitous
    priority: medium
    outputs:
      - "Next actions"
      - "Risk alerts"
      - "Scope adjustments"
    verification: "Recommendations actionable"

test_cases:
  T-RP-001:
    capability: "RP-001"
    scenario: "Healthy project review"
    given: "Project with 17/17 V-tests passed"
    when: "User runs `/aget-review-project`"
    then: "Reports OK status with 100% completion"
    verification_method: "automated"

  T-RP-002:
    capability: "RP-006"
    scenario: "Blockers detected"
    given: "Project with 2 failed V-tests and 1 BLOCKED item"
    when: "User runs `/aget-review-project`"
    then: "Blockers section lists 3 items"
    verification_method: "manual"

  T-RP-003:
    capability: "RP-003"
    scenario: "Multiple projects prompt"
    given: "3 active projects in planning/"
    when: "User runs `/aget-review-project` without path"
    then: "User prompted to select project"
    verification_method: "manual"

constraints:
  C-RP-001:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT modify project files during review."
    rationale: "Review is read-only assessment"

  C-RP-002:
    statement: "The SKILL shall report all gates, even if empty."
    rationale: "Complete visibility into project structure"

  C-RP-003:
    statement: "The SKILL shall NOT assess projects outside agent's write scope."
    rationale: "Respect agent boundaries"
