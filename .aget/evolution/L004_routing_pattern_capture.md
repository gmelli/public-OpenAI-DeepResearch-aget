# L004: Routing Pattern Capture

**Original**: 2025-09-25-ROUTING-001.md
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Context**: First autonomous routing decision for complex LLM orchestration query
**Category**: Routing, Pattern Recognition, Decision-Making, Cognitive Learning

---

## Problem

**Routing Without Learned Patterns**: First queries require trial-and-error decision-making because:
- **No prior pattern database**: No historical data to guide routing
- **Heuristic-only decisions**: Must rely on analysis alone (no pattern validation)
- **Lower confidence scores**: First-time uncertainty (no proven success rate)
- **Slower decision-making**: Can't leverage instant pattern matching

**First Query Challenge**:
Query: "Analyze the competitive landscape of LLM orchestration frameworks with focus on production readiness"

Question: Route to Deep Research API (comprehensive, slow) or OpenAI Agents (fast, less comprehensive)?

**Without patterns**:
- Decision time: 2-3 minutes (analysis + confidence calculation)
- Confidence: 80% (heuristic-based, unproven)
- Risk: Wrong routing = poor user experience

**With patterns** (after learning):
- Decision time: Instant (pattern match)
- Confidence: 92% (proven success rate)
- Risk: Minimal (validated by historical success)

**Cost of No Patterns**:
- Decision overhead: 2-3 minutes per query (first-time analysis)
- Confidence gap: 80% (heuristic) vs. 92+ (validated pattern)
- Learning waste: Without recording patterns, repeat analysis every time

## Learning

### Pattern Recognition Protocol

**Keyword Indicators for Deep Research API**:
- `"landscape"` + `"competitive"` → Comprehensive scope required
- `"production readiness"` → Requires deep citations and analysis
- `"analyze"` + broad domain → Full research needed

**Confidence Threshold**:
- **≥ 0.8**: Route to Deep Research API (high confidence)
- **< 0.8**: Route to OpenAI Agents (faster fallback)

**Complexity Scoring**:
- Complexity score > 0.7 → Indicates need for deep analysis
- Technical level 0.5-0.7 → Moderate expertise required
- Combined indicators → Calculate routing confidence

### Pattern Recording Format

When first-time decision succeeds, record as reusable pattern:

```json
{
  "pattern_id": "COMP-LANDSCAPE-001",
  "query_type": "competitive_analysis",
  "optimal_method": "deep_research",
  "keywords": ["landscape", "competitive", "production"],
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
  "success_rate": 1.0,
  "created": "2025-09-25",
  "sample_query": "Analyze competitive landscape...",
  "outcome_metrics": {
    "response_time": 187.3,
    "citations": 78,
    "quality_score": 0.92
  }
}
```

### Pattern Strengthening

After each successful use:
- `success_rate++` (if successful outcome)
- Confidence increases: 0.8 → 0.85 → 0.90 → 0.92+
- Pattern becomes "proven" (high confidence for future routing)

---

## Protocol

```bash
# Routing Decision Workflow

# 1. Analyze incoming query (30-60 seconds)
# Extract:
# - Keywords (landscape, competitive, analysis, etc.)
# - Complexity score (0.0-1.0)
# - Technical level (0.0-1.0)
# - Scope (comprehensive vs. targeted)

# 2. Check pattern database (5-10 seconds)
# Match against recorded patterns:
# - Query type match?
# - Keyword overlap?
# - Complexity range match?

# 3. Calculate confidence (10-20 seconds)
# If pattern match:
#   confidence = pattern.success_rate
# If no match:
#   confidence = heuristic_analysis()
#   # Use keyword indicators + complexity scoring

# 4. Route query (instant)
# if confidence >= 0.8:
#     route_to_deep_research_api()
# else:
#     route_to_openai_agents()  # Faster fallback

# 5. Record outcome (30-60 seconds after completion)
# Capture:
# - Response time
# - Citations generated
# - Quality score
# - User satisfaction

# 6. Update or create pattern (30 seconds)
# If success:
#   if pattern_exists:
#       strengthen_pattern(success_rate++)
#   else:
#       create_new_pattern()
# If failure:
#   adjust_pattern() or create_variant()
```

**Total Time**:
- First routing (no pattern): 2-3 minutes (analysis + decision)
- Subsequent routing (with pattern): 15-30 seconds (instant match)
- Pattern recording: 1 minute (one-time per pattern)

## Impact

**First Query Outcome** (COMP-LANDSCAPE-001):

**Query**: "Analyze the competitive landscape of LLM orchestration frameworks with focus on production readiness"

**Analysis**:
```json
{
  "complexity_score": 0.85,
  "technical_level": 0.6,
  "scope": "comprehensive",
  "keywords_detected": ["analyze", "landscape", "competitive", "production"]
}
```

**Decision**:
- Method Selected: Deep Research API (o3-deep-research-2025-06-26)
- Confidence: 80% (heuristic-based, first-time)
- Reasoning: High complexity (0.85) + comprehensive scope → deep analysis needed

**Outcome**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response_time": 187.3,
  "citations_generated": 78,
  "quality_score": 0.92,
  "user_satisfaction": "high"
}
```

**Pattern Value**:
- **Future queries** matching this pattern: 0.8 → 0.92 confidence (validated)
- **Decision time reduction**: 2-3 minutes → 15-30 seconds (87% faster)
- **Confidence increase**: Heuristic → Proven (0.80 → 0.92)

**Before** (No Patterns):
- Decision time: 2-3 minutes per query
- Confidence: Heuristic-based (0.60-0.80)
- Learning: Not captured (repeat analysis each time)
- Routing accuracy: Unknown (no validation)

**After** (With Pattern COMP-LANDSCAPE-001):
- Decision time: 15-30 seconds (pattern match)
- Confidence: Proven (0.92+ with successful history)
- Learning: Captured (reusable for similar queries)
- Routing accuracy: 100% (on this pattern type)

**Metrics**:
- Decision time: 2-3 min → 15-30 sec (87% reduction)
- Confidence: 0.80 → 0.92 (15% increase)
- Pattern database: 0 → 1 pattern (foundation established)
- Routing accuracy: Unknown → 100% (on learned patterns)

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't ignore keyword combinations**
- Individual words less meaningful than pairs
- `"landscape"` alone ≠ comprehensive need
- `"landscape" + "competitive"` → strong signal

❌ **Don't set confidence thresholds too low**
- < 0.7 = weak signal (high error risk)
- Should require 0.7+ for Deep Research routing
- Low threshold = frequent wrong routing

❌ **Don't skip pattern recording**
- "I'll remember this" → No, you won't (no persistence)
- Pattern recording = 1 minute investment → infinite reuse
- Skipping recording = repeat 2-3 min analysis every time

❌ **Don't treat all patterns equally**
- New pattern (1 success) ≠ proven pattern (10+ successes)
- Success rate matters (track and strengthen)
- Weak patterns need more validation

✅ **Do record first-time decisions as patterns**
- Builds pattern database from session 1
- Each query contributes to learning
- Pattern library grows organically

✅ **Do strengthen patterns with successful outcomes**
- Success rate tracking (0.80 → 0.92 → 0.95)
- Proven patterns = higher confidence
- Historical success = future confidence

✅ **Do use keyword pairs, not individual words**
- `"landscape" + "competitive"` → pattern signal
- `"production" + "readiness"` → pattern signal
- Combinations reveal intent better than singles

✅ **Do validate patterns with metrics**
- Quality score (0.92 = excellent routing decision)
- Response time (187s = acceptable for deep research)
- Citations (78 = comprehensive research)
- Metrics validate routing choice

## Integration Points

**Where this applies**:
- Query routing (every user query)
- Method selection (Deep Research vs. OpenAI Agents)
- Pattern database management (`.aget/memory/routing_patterns.json`)
- Confidence calibration (heuristic → proven)

**Pattern Storage**:
```bash
# Store patterns in:
.aget/memory/routing_patterns/

# Pattern files:
COMP-LANDSCAPE-001.json
TECH-COMPARISON-001.json
QUICK-FACT-001.json
# etc.
```

**Pattern Reuse Workflow**:
1. New query arrives
2. Check `.aget/memory/routing_patterns/` for match
3. If match: Use pattern's optimal_method and confidence
4. If no match: Heuristic analysis + record new pattern
