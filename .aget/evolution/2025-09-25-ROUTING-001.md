# Evolution Entry: First Routing Decision
**Type**: DECISION
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-25T14:30:00Z
**Agent**: DeepThink v0.1.0

## Context
First autonomous routing decision for complex query about LLM orchestration frameworks.

## Query Analysis
```json
{
  "query": "Analyze the competitive landscape of LLM orchestration frameworks with focus on production readiness",
  "analysis": {
    "complexity_score": 0.85,
    "technical_level": 0.6,
    "scope": "comprehensive",
    "keywords_detected": ["analyze", "landscape", "competitive", "production"]
  }
}
```

## Decision Process
1. **Pattern Recognition**: No prior patterns available (first query)
2. **Heuristic Analysis**:
   - "landscape" + "competitive" → suggests comprehensive research
   - "production readiness" → requires deep analysis
   - Complexity score 0.85 > threshold 0.7
3. **Confidence Calculation**:
   - Deep Research API: 0.8 confidence
   - OpenAI Agents: 0.3 confidence

## Decision
**Method Selected**: Deep Research API (o3-deep-research-2025-06-26)
**Confidence**: 80%
**Reasoning**: High complexity and comprehensive scope strongly indicate need for deep analysis

## Outcome
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response_time": 187.3,
  "citations_generated": 78,
  "quality_score": 0.92,
  "user_satisfaction": "pending"
}
```

## Learning
- Keyword combination "landscape" + "competitive" is strong indicator for Deep Research
- Production readiness queries benefit from comprehensive citations
- Response time of 3+ minutes acceptable for high-quality comprehensive research

## Pattern Recorded
```json
{
  "pattern_id": "COMP-LANDSCAPE-001",
  "query_type": "competitive_analysis",
  "optimal_method": "deep_research",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
  "success_rate": 1.0
}
```
