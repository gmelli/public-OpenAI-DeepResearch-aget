# Evolution Entry: Critical AGET Lesson - Repository Location Planning
**Type**: LESSON
**Timestamp**: 2025-09-25T23:45:00Z
**Agent**: OpenAI-DeepResearch-aget v0.3.0

## The Gap Discovered

When creating a new AGET, we failed to address a fundamental question:
**"Where will this agent live? Local only? GitHub? Which account? Public or private?"**

## What Happened

1. Created OpenAI_DeepResearch-aget locally
2. Built entire agent (structure, memory, personality)
3. Committed everything locally
4. Tried to "sign off" (which attempts push)
5. No remote repository exists!

## The Missing Conversation

Before creating ANY new AGET, we should establish:

### 1. Repository Strategy
```yaml
Repository Planning:
  - Location: [Local only | GitHub | GitLab | Other]
  - Visibility: [Private | Public]
  - Account: [Personal | Organization]
  - Name: [Exact repository name]
  - URL: [Where it will live]
```

### 2. Key Questions to Ask
- Is this a new repo or part of existing?
- Should it be public (showcase) or private (personal tool)?
- Which GitHub account will host it?
- What's the exact repository name?
- Should we create the GitHub repo first or after local development?

### 3. Integration Planning
- How does this relate to other repositories?
- Is it standalone or part of a monorepo?
- Will it be a submodule of something else?

## Proposed AGET Creation Protocol Enhancement

```python
class AGETCreation:
    def plan_repository(self):
        """MUST happen before creating agent"""
        return {
            "strategy": input("New repo or existing? "),
            "platform": input("GitHub/GitLab/Local? "),
            "visibility": input("Public/Private? "),
            "account": input("Which account? "),
            "name": input("Repository name? "),
            "create_now": input("Create remote first? Y/N ")
        }
```

## Impact on AGET Template

The `aget-cli-agent-template` should include:

1. **Repository planning step** in creation wizard
2. **Git remote check** in initialization
3. **Deployment strategy** documentation
4. **Sign-off protocol** that handles missing remotes gracefully

## Lesson for Future AGETs

**ALWAYS establish the repository strategy BEFORE creating the agent.**

This includes:
- WHERE it will live
- WHO owns it
- HOW it's accessed
- WHEN to create the remote

## Immediate Action Needed

For OpenAI_DeepResearch-aget:
1. Decide: Public or private?
2. Create GitHub repository
3. Link local to remote
4. Push the awakened agent
