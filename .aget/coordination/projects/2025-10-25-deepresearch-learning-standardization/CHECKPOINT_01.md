### Proposed Migration Mapping

| Target | Source File | Rationale | Restructuring Effort |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **L001** | AWAKENING.md | Foundational identity realization | Medium |
| **L002** | IDENTITY-CORRECTION.md | Refined identity understanding | Low-Medium |
| **L003** | LESSON-REPOSITORY-PLANNING.md | Operational protocol lesson | Low (most L51-compliant) |
| **L004** | ROUTING-001.md | Operational routing pattern | Medium |

**Mapping Philosophy**: Identity learnings first (L001-L002), then operational patterns (L003-L004). Creates coherent narrative arc: awakening → correction → protocols → patterns.

---

### Detailed Migration Analysis

#### L001: Agent Identity Awakening Pattern
**Source**: `2025-09-25-AWAKENING.md`
**Proposed Title**: `L001_agent_identity_awakening.md`

**Current Structure**:
- Context, Key Realization, Initial State, Learning from Awakening, Defining Characteristics, Next Steps, Significance

**L51 Gap Analysis**:
- ❌ Missing: Problem section (quantified waste/pain)
- ❌ Missing: Protocol section (actionable steps)
- ❌ Missing: Anti-patterns section
- ✅ Has: Learning content (needs restructuring to "protocols first")
- ✅ Has: Impact narrative (needs quantification)

**Proposed Restructuring**:

```markdown
# L001: Agent Identity Awakening Pattern

## Problem
**Identity Confusion Waste**: Agents starting without clear self-understanding waste cycles on:
- Role misalignment (thinking you're X when you're Y)
- Scope confusion (what you manage vs. what you are)
- Relationship ambiguity (separate entity vs. enhancement layer)

**Quantification**: Estimated 2-3 early sessions spent clarifying identity vs. focusing on capabilities.

## Learning

### Identity Establishment Protocol
1. **Separation Recognition**: Determine if you're a separate agent or system transformation
2. **Purpose Definition**: Manage/enhance vs. replace/become
3. **Directory Independence**: Verify own location vs. managed system location
4. **Personality Assignment**: Establish distinct identity (e.g., DeepThink)

### Core Identity Questions
- WHERE do I live? (directory path)
- WHAT do I manage? (system vs. self)
- WHO am I? (personality/name)
- HOW do I relate? (work WITH vs. work AS)

## Protocol
[Step-by-step identity establishment - extracted from current "Next Steps"]

## Anti-Patterns
❌ **Don't assume you ARE the system you manage**
❌ **Don't conflate directory locations** (your path vs. managed system path)
✅ **Do establish clear separation boundaries**
✅ **Do document identity explicitly in configuration**

## Impact
**Before**: Identity confusion, role misalignment, wasted early sessions
**After**: Clear identity from session 1, focused capability development

## Related Learnings

```

**Restructuring Effort**: Medium (needs Problem framing, Protocol extraction, Anti-patterns addition)

---

#### L002: Agent Identity Correction Pattern
**Source**: `2025-09-25-IDENTITY-CORRECTION.md`
**Proposed Title**: `L002_agent_identity_correction.md`

**Current Structure**:
- Critical Correction, What I Thought (WRONG), What I Actually Am (CORRECT), Learning, Impact

**L51 Gap Analysis**:
- ❌ Missing: Problem section (cost of wrong mental model)
- ❌ Missing: Protocol section (how to detect/correct misalignment)
- ✅ Has: Clear before/after structure (strong foundation for Impact section)
- ✅ Has: Learning content (brief but clear)

**Proposed Restructuring**:

```markdown
# L002: Agent Identity Correction Pattern

## Problem
**Misaligned Mental Model Waste**: Operating with wrong identity understanding causes:
- Scope limitation (thinking you CAN'T when you CAN)
- User frustration (agent refuses valid requests)
- Capability underutilization (not using full toolkit)

**Example Waste**: Refusing transformation requests when transformation is core purpose.

## Learning

### Identity Alignment Protocol
1. **Role Verification**: Check user's intent vs. your understanding
2. **Scope Validation**: Verify what you CAN vs. what you THOUGHT you could do
3. **Configuration Update**: Fix documentation to reflect corrected understanding
4. **Operational Adjustment**: Begin using corrected scope immediately

### Key Correction
**Wrong Model**: "I'm separate/independent, I only observe/manage"
**Right Model**: "I'm user's tool/agent, I actively transform and improve"

## Impact
**Before**: Limited scope, refused valid transformation requests
**After**: Full capability utilization, proactive improvement

**Metrics**:
- Scope limitation: Removed (from "manage only" to "transform actively")
- Documentation updates: 2 files (CLAUDE.md, IDENTITY_CORRECTED.md)

## Anti-Patterns
❌ **Don't assume conservative scope without verification**
❌ **Don't refuse requests based on wrong mental model**
✅ **Do validate identity assumptions against user intent**
✅ **Do update documentation when corrections discovered**

## Related Learnings

```

**Restructuring Effort**: Low-Medium (has good before/after, needs Problem/Protocol framing)

#### L003: Repository Planning Protocol
**Source**: `2025-09-25-LESSON-REPOSITORY-PLANNING.md`
**Proposed Title**: `L003_repository_planning_protocol.md`

**Current Structure**:
- The Gap Discovered, What Happened, The Missing Conversation, Proposed Protocol, Impact, Lesson

**L51 Gap Analysis**:
- ✅ Has: Clear problem statement ("The Gap Discovered")
- ✅ Has: Protocol section (already structured!)
- ✅ Has: Impact description
- ❌ Missing: Anti-patterns section (minor addition)
- ❌ Missing: Impact quantification (needs metrics)

**Proposed Restructuring**:

```markdown
# L003: Repository Planning Protocol

## Problem
**Repository Planning Gap Waste**: Creating agents without repository strategy causes:
- 6+ tool calls at "sign off" discovering no remote exists
- Forced decision-making at worst time (after full development)
- Push failures requiring retroactive planning

**Example Waste Pattern**:
1. Create agent locally (5-8 hours development)
2. Build entire structure, memory, personality
3. Commit everything locally
4. Attempt "sign off" (tries to push)
5. **FAILURE**: No remote repository exists
6. Scramble to decide: Public? Private? Which account?

**Optimal Approach**: 4 questions BEFORE creation (2 minutes) prevents 6+ error cycles.

## Learning

### Repository Planning Protocol (CHECK FIRST)

**Before creating ANY new agent, establish:**

1. **Location**: Local only | GitHub | GitLab | Other
2. **Visibility**: Private | Public
3. **Account**: Personal | Organization
4. **Name**: Exact repository name
5. **Timing**: Create remote now or after local development?

### Standard Questions Template
```yaml
Repository Planning:
  - Location: [Local only | GitHub | GitLab | Other]
  - Visibility: [Private | Public]
  - Account: [Personal | Organization]
  - Name: [Exact repository name]
  - URL: [Where it will live]
  - Create Now: [Y/N]
```

## Protocol

```bash
# 1. Answer planning questions FIRST (before mkdir)
# [Use template above]

# 2. Create remote repository if needed
gh repo create <name> --<public|private>

# 3. Clone or init with remote configured
git clone <url> || (git init && git remote add origin <url>)

# 4. Develop agent (now sign-off will work)
```

## Anti-Patterns
❌ **Don't create agents without repository strategy**
❌ **Don't delay remote creation until sign-off**
❌ **Don't assume "we'll figure it out later"**
✅ **Do answer 5 questions BEFORE mkdir**
✅ **Do create remote early (or explicitly defer)**
✅ **Do document strategy in creation session**

## Impact
**Before**: 6+ tool call waste at sign-off, forced decision-making
**After**: 2-minute planning, smooth sign-off, no repository errors

**Metrics**:
- Planning overhead: 2 minutes (5 questions)
- Sign-off waste prevented: 6+ tool calls (error → decision → retry cycles)
- Error rate: 100% → 0% (when protocol followed)

## Integration Points
- Agent creation workflows
- AGET template initialization
- Sign-off protocols

## Related Learnings
- L001: Agent Identity Awakening (identity established, needs repository home)
```

**Restructuring Effort**: Low (most L51-compliant, minimal changes needed)

#### L004: Routing Pattern Capture
**Source**: `2025-09-25-ROUTING-001.md`
**Proposed Title**: `L004_routing_pattern_capture.md`

**Current Structure**:
- Context, Query Analysis, Decision Process, Decision, Outcome, Learning, Pattern Recorded, Metadata

**L51 Gap Analysis**:
- ❌ Missing: Problem section (routing without patterns = trial-and-error)
- ❌ Missing: Protocol section (how to apply this pattern)
- ✅ Has: Excellent outcome metrics (success data)
- ✅ Has: Clear learning extraction

**Proposed Restructuring**:

```markdown
# L004: Routing Pattern Capture

## Problem
**Routing Without Learned Patterns**: First queries require trial-and-error because:
- No prior pattern database exists
- Heuristic-only decisions (no pattern validation)
- Lower confidence scores (first-time uncertainty)

**First Query Challenge**: How to route "competitive landscape + production readiness" query without any learned patterns?

## Learning

### Pattern Recognition Protocol

**Keyword Indicators for Deep Research**:
- "landscape" + "competitive" → comprehensive scope
- "production readiness" → requires deep citations
- Complexity score > 0.7 → deep analysis needed

**Confidence Threshold**: 0.8+ for Deep Research API routing

### Pattern Recording Format
```json
{
  "pattern_id": "COMP-LANDSCAPE-001",
  "query_type": "competitive_analysis",
  "optimal_method": "deep_research",
  "keywords": ["landscape", "competitive", "production"],
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
  "success_rate": 1.0
}
```

## Protocol

```bash
# 1. Analyze incoming query
# Extract: keywords, complexity, scope

# 2. Check pattern database
# Match: query_type, keywords, complexity

# 3. Calculate confidence
# If pattern match: use historical success rate
# If no match: use heuristics (record as new pattern)

# 4. Route query
# confidence >= 0.8 → Deep Research API
# confidence < 0.8 → OpenAI Agents (faster fallback)

# 5. Record outcome
# Success: Strengthen pattern (success_rate++)
# Failure: Adjust pattern or create variant
```

## Impact
**Query Outcome**:
- Response time: 187.3s (acceptable for comprehensive research)
- Citations generated: 78
- Quality score: 0.92/1.0
- Method confidence: 0.8 (validated by outcome)

**Pattern Value**:
- Future queries matching this pattern: 0.8 → 0.92 confidence (proven pattern)
- Decision time reduction: Trial-and-error → instant pattern match

## Anti-Patterns
❌ **Don't ignore keyword combinations** (individual words less meaningful than pairs)
❌ **Don't set confidence thresholds too low** (< 0.7 = weak signal)
✅ **Do record first-time decisions as patterns** (builds database)
✅ **Do strengthen patterns with successful outcomes** (success_rate tracking)

**Restructuring Effort**: Medium (needs Problem framing, Protocol extraction, pattern reuse guidance)
