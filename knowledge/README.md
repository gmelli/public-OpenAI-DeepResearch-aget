# Domain Knowledge (OpenAI Deep Research)

This directory contains domain-specific beliefs, patterns, and heuristics
that are NOT portable to other agents (per L296 portability test).

## Expected Content

- Deep research methodology patterns
- Topic-specific research heuristics
- Source evaluation criteria

## Currently Empty

This agent currently has no domain-specific knowledge files.
Framework learnings are in `.aget/evolution/`.
