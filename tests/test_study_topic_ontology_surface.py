"""Two-polarity guard: the knowledge/ontology tier must reach BOTH .md and .yaml.

Defect this closes (gh#2257, reported by a downstream consuming agent
2026-08-15, corroborated here): `find_knowledge()` globbed `rglob('*.md')` only,
while `SURFACES_SEARCHED` advertised `knowledge/** + ontology/**` and has since
v3.25 (C-25-14, 2026-07-04). Governed vocabulary lives in `ONTOLOGY_*.yaml`, so
the tier the surface exists to expose was never opened on any run. The specs tier
(find_specs) already globbed BOTH extensions, which is the argument that the
ontology glob was an oversight rather than a scope decision.

Measured at this seat before the fix: 82 yaml files / 3,678,886 bytes unreachable
against 3 md files / 53,726 bytes reachable -- 1.4% of ontology bytes. The term
`FrameworkManagerArchetype`, this agent's OWN archetype concept (C610, cited in
its own AGENTS.md), occurred 31 times in ontology/*.yaml and returned 0 hits.

WHY THIS FILE ASSERTS NON-ZERO, AND WHY THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART.
The nearest house template, test_study_topic_searches_spec_tier, asserts only
that the findings key EXISTS ("key present even if empty") and that a substring
appears in the SURFACES_SEARCHED source. That test PASSES against the exact
defect gh#2257 reports: a declared tier returning a confident zero. A guard
copied from it would have been a surviving mutant. A fix verified only by "the
suite still passes" cannot distinguish repaired from unchanged, so every positive
polarity below asserts a POSITIVE COUNT over a term planted only in a .yaml.

SCOPE AT CANONICAL: this copy carries the reach polarities only. The
instance seat additionally derives the SURFACES_SEARCHED row from a
KNOWLEDGE_EXTENSIONS tuple and guards that separately; canonical has the
minimal glob fix, so those assertions are omitted here rather than failing
against symbols canonical does not define.

BOTH POLARITIES ARE ASSERTED ON PURPOSE (the L1300 house idiom):
  - a term present only in .yaml MUST be found  -> fails before the fix;
  - a term present only in .md MUST still be found -> the fix adds reach without
    trading it away;
  - a term present in NEITHER MUST return zero -> proves the positive polarities
    are real matches and not a matcher that accepts everything.

Refs: gh#2257 (this defect) -- gh#1852 (open umbrella: treat the study_topic
scope/index/scoring family as ONE search-contract audit, not point-fixes) --
L1300 (declared scope must be DERIVED from executed scope; study_topic.py is its
instance #1) -- L1266 (a vocabulary pre-check that read one surface and reported
absence) -- L1330 (absence claims fail on polarity, not on care).
