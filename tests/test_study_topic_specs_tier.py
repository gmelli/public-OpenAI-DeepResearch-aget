Regression guard: the spec tier must SURVIVE scoring, not merely be found.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, stated precisely because the failure repeated.

`find_specs` was added to close gh#1580 — a surface CLAIMED in the printed
banner while no finder populated it, so every study reported "0 specs" and a
reader trusting the banner read that as "no spec exists". The function's own
docstring names this "manufactured absence" and says it is closed.

It was not closed. The finder was restored and the SCORING path re-zeroed it.
Measured 2026-08-05: `find_specs('proposal')` returned 62 results while the
rendered report printed `| Specs | 0 | - |`, because main() re-scores every item
through composite_score() and find_specs emitted two fields no other finder
emitted:

  1. `matches` instead of `match_count` — composite_score reads `match_count`
     and defaults it to 1, collapsing the log-damped count term.
  2. `keyword_coverage` defaulting to 0.0 instead of 1.0 — and
     search_file_for_topic OMITS that key for single-token topics, so the
     default IS the value. composite_score multiplies by it, so every spec
     scored exactly 0.0 and fell below RELEVANCE_FLOOR_DEFAULT.

Consequence measured the same day at a peer seat: asked for the formal
definition of "proposal", it reported no formal definition had ever been
written, while AGET_CHANGE_PROPOSAL_SPEC v1.2.0 (CAP-CP-001..005, 12 V-tests)
sat in canonical. The instrument supplied false evidence of non-existence.

THE LESSON THIS FILE ENCODES: a finder test is not a tier test. Asserting that
find_specs() returns rows proves nothing about what the reader sees, because the
defect lived entirely downstream of the finder. Every assertion below therefore
runs the FULL pipeline and reads the RENDERED output — the surface a human
actually trusts.

Both polarities are asserted. A test that only proves specs appear would pass if
the floor were deleted outright, which would reintroduce the noise the floor
exists to suppress. See feedback: "a check whose predicate cannot detect its
subject" and "assert both polarities".

    WHY A FIXTURE AND NOT AN ENVIRONMENT BRANCH (2026-08-09).

    `find_canonical_spec_roots()` resolves by probing SIBLINGS of the agent
    root, so whether the canonical tier is reachable is a property of the
    checkout topology, not of this repository. Two weaker designs were tried
    and rejected:

      1. Assert unconditionally that the definitional spec surfaces. This is
         what shipped first. It encoded the author's workstation layout as a
         repository invariant and failed CI on 3.10/3.11/3.12 from its first
         push, never green on a runner.
      2. Branch on the ambient environment — assert the spec when a root
         happens to resolve, assert UNAVAILABLE when none does. Green
         everywhere, but each environment then exercises only ONE polarity, so
         no single run ever proves both. A regression in the branch the local
         host does not take is invisible until it reaches CI.

    Synthesising both topologies makes both polarities run in EVERY
    environment, which is what the sibling files
    (`test_study_topic_canonical_surface.py`,
    `test_study_topic_canonical_pattern_tier.py`) already do — they were
    hermetic and passing in CI while this file was red.
