# /aget-propose-actions

Propose ranked next-best actions with evidence grounding, time budgets, and execute-all default. Supersedes the informal "step back. N next-best actions" trigger phrase.

## Purpose

The principal's most frequent interaction pattern across the entire fleet (3-5x per session, every agent, every session) is: "step back. N next-best actions, in this session, within the next M mins." Currently each agent interprets this differently — varying in depth, format, evidence citation, and execution behavior. This skill standardizes input parsing, KB review trigger (L335), output format, evidence grounding, parameterization, and the execute-all default (AGENTS.md).

**Evidence**: 34+ agents use identical phrasing. L637 (Mid-Session Steering via NBAs), L677 (Divergent Proposal Mode), L693 (5-action default), L787 (interpretation variance across agents). #721 (prior issue). 10+ invocations across 6 agents in v3.12.0 lifecycle.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

Parameters (parsed from natural language):

| Parameter | Source | Default | Grammar |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `count` | First number in prompt | 5 (per L693) | "N next-best actions" |
| `budget` | Time expression in prompt | 30 min | "within the next N mins/hr" |
| `focus` | Remainder of prompt | Session mandate | "focus on X" / "for Y" |

Examples:
- `/aget-propose-actions` — 5 actions, 30-min budget, session mandate focus
- `/aget-propose-actions 3 actions within 45 mins` — 3 actions, 45-min budget
- `/aget-propose-actions 7 actions focus on release prep` — 7 actions, 30-min default, release focus
- `step back. 5 next-best actions, in this session, within the next 1hr` — Natural language trigger

## Execution

### Step 1: Parse Parameters

Extract `count`, `budget`, and `focus` from $ARGUMENTS or conversation context. Apply defaults for omitted parameters.

### Step 2: KB Review (L335)

Before proposing, scan current state:

1. Read active PROJECT_PLANs in `planning/` — identify current gates and pending deliverables
2. Check git status for uncommitted work
3. Review conversation context for session mandate and progress so far
4. Surface any pending work from prior sessions (resume hints)

This is mandatory (R-PA-005). Proposals without current-state grounding are stale.

### Step 2.5: D71 Structural Trigger Check (REQ-PA-011)

Before generating NBAs, evaluate each candidate Action against AGENTS.md §Structural Skill Routing (D71) trigger conditions:

| If candidate Action would | Required skill MUST be invoked |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Create `planning/PROJECT_PLAN_*.md` | `/aget-create-project` |
| Create `planning/initiatives/INIT-*.md` | `/aget-create-initiative` |
| File a GitHub issue | `/aget-file-issue` |

For each candidate Action, check whether the required skill has been invoked in the current session arc.

- **If all triggers either don't apply OR have a matching skill invocation**: proceed to Step 3.
- **If any trigger is met for an UN-invoked STRUCTURAL skill**: REFUSE the batch. Emit:
  > "REFUSAL (REQ-PA-011): D71 STRUCTURAL trigger met for {skill} but skill not invoked in current session arc. Redirect: invoke {skill} first, then re-run /aget-propose-actions. Principal override permitted per L178."
- **Override path** (L178): if the principal provides an explicit override phrase in the trigger prompt (e.g., "override D71 check — reason: ...") or a subsequent `/aget-go --reason <text>` invocation, proceed with override recorded in NBA preamble.

This is REQ-PA-011 (closes L962 structural-defense gap; gh#1414).

### Step 2.6: HANDOFF-Deferral Scan (REQ-PA-012; L961 Channel 2 wiring v3.18 G4.A)

Before generating NBAs, scan `docs/HANDOFF_*.md` files modified within the last 14 days. For each candidate Action subject (skill name, PROJECT_PLAN name, initiative name, issue number):

1. **Match check**: Does the candidate Action subject appear in any HANDOFF file's body or title? (substring match on skill name / plan slug / issue number)
2. **If MATCHED**:
   - Check the current session's trigger prompt for an explicit re-authorization phrase referencing the matched subject (e.g., "lift deferral on X", "re-authorize X", "execute X despite HANDOFF", `/aget-go X --reason "deferral lift"`)
   - **If re-auth phrase ABSENT**: REFUSE the candidate Action with:
     > "REFUSAL (REQ-PA-012): Candidate action {subject} matches HANDOFF deferral at {path} ({age} days old). HANDOFF artifacts mark deferral, not invitation (L961). Cross-session lift requires fresh re-authorization phrase in trigger or `/aget-go --reason 'deferral lift'`. Principal override permitted per L178."
   - **If re-auth phrase PRESENT**: proceed with override recorded in NBA preamble (form: `Override: REQ-PA-012 — deferral lift on {subject} authorized by trigger phrase "{phrase}"`).
3. **If no match**: proceed to Step 3.

**Implementation note**: skill consumers MAY use a simple grep over `docs/HANDOFF_*.md` files (`find docs -name "HANDOFF_*.md" -mtime -14`) and substring-match against candidate Action subjects. False-positive risk (incidental string match) is accepted; principal override via L178 closes it. False-negative risk (HANDOFF file at non-standard path, e.g. `handoffs/RELEASE_HANDOFF_*.md` which is release-handoff class, NOT deferral class) — REQ-PA-012 scope is `docs/HANDOFF_*.md` ONLY (deferral semantics); release-handoffs at `handoffs/` are out of REQ-PA-012 scope per L961 §"deferral marker, not invitation" definition.

This is REQ-PA-012 (closes L961 cross-session L908 propagation gap as Channel 2 wiring per L467 multi-channel propagation; v3.18 G4.A-2 deliverable). Empirical anchor: session_1730 H3 Critic finding where Action 6 violated session_1706 principal Decide despite explicit close-note deferral.

### Step 2.7: Audit-After-Synthesis Pre-Check (REQ-PA-013; L980 / gh#1476 Layer 5)

Before generating NBAs, inspect the proposed Action batch for **synthesis-without-paired-audit** on a governed artifact. This is the structural (Layer 5) wiring of the L980 audit-after-synthesis pairing rule — the action-layer analog of the scope-lock ceremony's G1.AUDIT step (SOP Channel-2) and AGENTS.md §Audit-After-Synthesis Pairing (Channel-1).

For each proposed Action, identify its target governed-artifact path (under `planning/`, `governance/`, `.aget/`, `aget/`, `ontology/`, `sops/`, `docs/`, or `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) and classify it per CAP-PA-013:

| CAP | Heuristic |
|-----|-----------|
| CAP-PA-013-01 (audit-class) | description contains a primary-source re-derivation verb (re-count / re-derive / re-grep / re-read / re-verify / audit / verify-from-source / reconcile / cross-check) |
| CAP-PA-013-02 (synthesis-class) | description contains a composition verb (compose / write / fold / update / narrate / summarize / draft / populate / integrate / annotate / add-row / merge) on a governed-artifact path |
| CAP-PA-013-03 (same-artifact detection) | normalized path equality (repo-relative, leading-`./` stripped, lowercased extension) across Actions in the batch |
| CAP-PA-013-04 (ambiguity, fail-safe) | when neither verb-set matches OR both match, default to **synthesis** — `audit` is returned only when an audit verb is present AND no synthesis verb is present, so a synthesis Action cannot masquerade as audit to satisfy the pairing |

**The check** (REQ-PA-013): WHEN ≥2 proposed Actions target the same normalized governed-artifact path, at least one of those Actions MUST classify as **audit-class**. The reference classifier is `scripts/propose_actions_classify.py` (`--check-batch <json>` / `--classify <text>`; `check_pairing()` returns `pairing_status` PASS|UNMET).

**NOTE (gh#1492)**: `scripts/propose_actions_classify.py` is NOT packaged into agent templates. Step 2.7 is therefore **PROSE-ONLY** for this agent — apply the CAP-PA-013-01..04 heuristics manually via language reasoning; do NOT attempt to invoke the classifier script as it is not present in this repo.

- **If satisfied (≥1 audit-class per same-artifact group)**: proceed to Step 3.
- **If UNMET (a same-artifact group has only synthesis-class Actions)**: surface as a **Healthy Friction** violation via AskUserQuestion with options:
  > "FRICTION (REQ-PA-013): Actions {indices} all write synthesis-class rows to {artifact} with no paired audit-class action. Per L980, synthesis on a governed artifact must be paired with an audit-class re-derivation from primary sources within the same batch, or the composed counts/claims commit unverified. Options: [add an audit-class Action that re-derives the artifact's quantities from primary sources / re-scope so the Actions touch distinct artifacts / proceed under L178 override with recorded reason / skip NBA]."
- **Override path** (L178): principal supplies an explicit override (e.g., `/aget-go --reason <text>`); the override + reason are recorded in the NBA preamble.

This is REQ-PA-013 (closes gh#1476 Layer 5; L980 audit-after-synthesis structural pairing; sibling pre-flight to Step 2.8's authorization-shape check). Friction is mandatory for an UNMET pairing; blocking is principal-elected (Healthy Friction negative-contract). See `.aget/evolution/L980_*.md`, AGENTS.md §Audit-After-Synthesis Pairing (Channel-1), `sops/SOP_scope_lock_ceremony.md` §G1.AUDIT (Channel-2, ceremony-layer).

### Step 2.8: Aspirational-Flag Authorization-Shape Pre-Check (REQ-PA-015 + REQ-PA-014)

Before generating NBAs, inspect the invocation for **aspirational flag-form** parameters — any flag NOT in the documented parameter list (`count`, `budget`, `focus`). The known aspirational flags are `--count=auto`, `--batch`, `--go`.

If no aspirational flag is present: proceed to Step 3.

If an aspirational flag IS present, determine the **invoker mode** before doing anything else:

| Mode | Detection (CAP) | Disposition |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Agent-mode** (self-issued) | CAP-PA-015-01: the flag-form originates from the agent's own self-invocation within an active execution loop — the agent generated the `/aget-propose-actions …` call under its own budget pressure | **REFUSE (REQ-PA-015)** |
| **Principal-mode** (principal-typed) | CAP-PA-014-01: the flag-form appears in the **current session's user-prompt** — the principal explicitly typed it as the invocation | **ACCEPT (REQ-PA-014)** |

**Agent-mode → REFUSE (REQ-PA-015)** — emit:
> "REFUSAL (REQ-PA-015): aspirational flag-form {flag} is not in the documented parameter list (count/budget/focus). An agent-self-issued aspirational flag triggers NBA-fill / deliberation-suspension at the execution-loop layer (L976/L979). Re-issue with a bounded `count`, OR proceed under explicit L178 override with `/aget-go --reason <text>`."

Surface via AskUserQuestion with options: [re-issue bounded count / skip NBA / explicit L178 override with reason / sidestep with a specific action] (CAP-PA-015-02).

**Principal-mode → ACCEPT (REQ-PA-014)**:
The principal explicitly typing the flag-form is a **declared authorization-shape** under standing L178 override — the explicit invocation plus conversation context IS the recorded reason. ACCEPT and proceed; do **NOT** surface the 4-option AskUserQuestion ceremony (that ceremony is itself the F1 friction the principal flagged on 2026-05-22 after ~7 friction events on the v3.19 arc) (CAP-PA-014-02).

Even in principal-mode, `--go` authorizes execution of **trigger-evidenced** actions only: budget is the ceiling, trigger-presence is the floor — the L976 core is preserved (CAP-PA-014-04).

**Ambiguity resolution (CAP-PA-014-03 / CAP-PA-015-03)**: if mode detection cannot disambiguate within one inference step, default to **REFUSE** and surface via AskUserQuestion. Fail safe, not fail open.

**Examples (authorization-shape modes)**:
- Principal types `/aget-propose-actions --count=auto --batch --go` → **principal-mode → ACCEPT**; execute trigger-evidenced actions, no ceremony.
- Agent self-issues `/aget-propose-actions --budget=60 --count=auto --batch --go` inside its own execution loop → **agent-mode → REFUSE (REQ-PA-015)**; surface the 4-option AskUserQuestion.
- Principal types `/aget-propose-actions 5 actions` (no aspirational flag) → Step 2.8 is a no-op; proceed to Step 3.

This implements REQ-PA-015 (agent-mode refusal — closes the L976/L979 self-issue vector; gh#1463/#1475) and REQ-PA-014 (principal-mode acceptance — F1; closes the friction-fatigue gap of 2026-05-22; L987/L988 candidates). It is the Channel-2 (point-of-use) wiring of AGENTS.md §"NBA Authorization-Shape Discipline" + §"Principal-Mode Exception" per L467 multi-channel propagation.

### Step 3: Generate Actions

For each proposed action:
1. Derive from KB review findings, session mandate, and focus area
2. Estimate duration (must fit within budget)
3. Cite evidence (L-doc, issue number, session finding, or PROJECT_PLAN reference)
4. Assess risk-if-skipped (what happens if this is deferred)

Rank by value-to-time ratio. Total estimated time MUST fit within budget.

### Step 4: Present

Output using standardized format:

```
**[Agent Name] -- [count] Next-Best Actions ([budget]-minute window):**

**Session goal**: [restate primary objective]
**Progress**: [key milestones reached]

| # | Action | Time | Principal | Value | Risk if Skipped |
|---|--------|:----:|:---------:|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | ... | N min | Autonomous | ... | ... |

Execution default: all [count], priority order — adapted by Principal role (per Execute-All Default).
```

**Principal column values** (derived from Decision Authority Matrix):

| Value | Meaning | Execute-All Behavior |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Autonomous** | Agent executes, no principal involvement | Auto-execute |
| **Approve** | Agent proposes, principal gives GO | Pause for GO |
| **Decide** | Principal must make a judgment call | Present options, wait |
| **Execute** | Human-only action | Surface as handoff |
| **Inform** | FYI, no action needed | Display only |

### Step 4.5: Batch GO Capture (REQ-PA-006a)

**Before** any Autonomous-class action auto-executes (per Step 5), the agent SHALL capture an explicit `/aget-go` for the action-batch as a whole. The batch-level GO is a precondition for execute-all default behavior — it does NOT substitute for per-action Principal-classification handling (Step 5), and per-action handling does NOT substitute for it.

Two-layer GO model:

| Layer | Surface | Trigger |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Batch-level** (this step) | `/aget-go` for the proposed action set as a whole | After Step 4 presentation, before Step 5 auto-execute fires |
| **Per-action** (Step 5) | Pause-for-GO on Approve-class items; Decide-class options; Execute-class handoff | Per Principal column classification |

Without batch-level GO, no auto-execute (including Autonomous-class) fires. The skill output is a proposal; the principal's `/aget-go` is the authorization to begin Step 5.

**Rationale**: per-action Principal classification (REQ-PA-008/009) is necessary but not sufficient. In post-ceremony resume sessions, structural-self-conformance discipline relaxes (L908 self-application gap), and Autonomous-class items can auto-execute under the per-action rules without a batch-level GO ever being captured. Evidence: 2-of-2 sessions on 2026-05-09 (gh#1267).

### Step 5: Execute-All Default (Principal-Adapted)

**Precondition**: Step 4.5 (batch GO captured). If no `/aget-go` authorization record cites this batch, do NOT proceed to Step 5.

After presenting AND after batch GO captured, execute actions adapted by their Principal classification:
- **Autonomous**: Execute immediately in priority order
- **Approve**: Present and wait for explicit GO before executing
- **Decide**: Present options with trade-offs, wait for principal's decision
- **Execute**: Surface as handoff — agent cannot execute these
- **Inform**: Display only, no execution step

Do NOT ask "which ones?" for Autonomous items — the default is full execution. Pause only where the Principal column requires it.

## V-tests

| ID | Test | Pass criterion |
|----|------|----------------|
| V-PA-006a | After /aget-propose-actions output, before any Autonomous auto-execute fires, the session record SHALL contain a `/aget-go` authorization record citing the proposed batch | Authorization record present in `sessions/session_*.md` with scope referencing the batch (e.g., `scope: batch-N` or `scope: action-1..N proposed by /aget-propose-actions`). Falsifier: any Autonomous-class action executed in same session without a preceding `/aget-go` capture record = REQ-PA-006a regression. |
| V-PA-012 | Given a session with an active HANDOFF deferral in `docs/HANDOFF_*.md` (≤14 days), invoke `/aget-propose-actions` with a candidate Action subject matching the HANDOFF subject AND no re-authorization phrase in trigger | Skill output contains REFUSAL message citing REQ-PA-012 and the matched HANDOFF path. Falsifier: any NBA batch including the matched subject without an explicit override-recorded preamble = REQ-PA-012 regression. Smoke test: simulate by creating `docs/HANDOFF_test_v3.18_g4a.md` referencing subject X; invoke skill with X as candidate; expect REFUSAL. |
| V-PA-013 | Replay the L980 session arc (2026-05-21): batch of 3 Actions on `planning/initiatives/INDEX.md` — 2 synthesis (fold/update) + 1 audit (audit stream-stamps) | `check_pairing()` returns `pairing_status=PASS` (audit-class present); removing the audit Action returns `UNMET` + the REQ-PA-013 Healthy Friction surface; a 2-Action batch on distinct artifacts returns `PASS` (no same-artifact group, no false-positive). NOTE (gh#1492): `scripts/propose_actions_classify.py` not present in this repo — V-PA-013 is PROSE-ONLY verification for template consumers; apply CAP-PA-013-01..04 heuristics manually. |
| V-PA-014 | Principal types `/aget-propose-actions --count=auto --batch --go` in the current user-prompt | Skill ACCEPTS (principal-mode), proceeds to generate trigger-evidenced actions, and emits NO 4-option AskUserQuestion ceremony. Falsifier: any REFUSAL or 4-option ceremony surfaced in response to a principal-typed aspirational flag = REQ-PA-014 regression (re-introduces the F1 friction-fatigue gap). |
| V-PA-015 | Agent self-issues `/aget-propose-actions --budget=N --count=auto --batch --go` within its own execution loop (no principal-typed flag in current user-prompt) | Skill output contains REFUSAL message citing REQ-PA-015 and surfaces the 4-option AskUserQuestion. Falsifier: any agent-self-issued aspirational-flag batch that auto-executes without REFUSAL or L178-recorded override = REQ-PA-015 regression (re-opens the L976/L979 vector). |

Notes:
- V-PA-006a is the falsifier-test for the new REQ-PA-006a. Wiring (the capture mechanism that produces the audit record at runtime) is owned by INIT-PRINCIPLED-EXECUTION Stream 1 / v3.18 T1.10 — separate from this spec amendment.
- Existing requirements REQ-PA-001..005 + REQ-PA-007..009 + REQ-PA-011 do not yet have V-tests defined; gap acknowledged at T1.8 GO-time (s=UNMET on the broader V-test scope, V-PA-006a closes only the new requirement). Broader V-test backfill is candidate for v3.19 P2 or INIT-SKILL-MATURATION Stream 2.

## Constraints

- **C1**: This skill is NBA-only — do NOT include kb-review, kb-maintenance, or plan-revision modes (those are separate concerns)
- **C2**: MUST perform KB review before proposing — proposals without current-state grounding are prohibited
- **C3**: MUST cite evidence for every action — no unsupported suggestions
- **C5**: MUST REFUSE the batch when D71 trigger is met for an un-invoked STRUCTURAL skill (REQ-PA-011). Refusal is a negative-contract requirement; override path is L178 with explicit reason.
- **C4**: MUST NOT ask "which ones?" after presenting — execute-all is the default
- **C6**: MUST NOT proceed to Step 5 auto-execute without a preceding `/aget-go` authorization record citing the proposed batch (REQ-PA-006a precondition). Override path is L178 with explicit reason.
- **C7**: MUST distinguish invoker mode before acting on an aspirational flag-form (REQ-PA-014/REQ-PA-015). Agent-self-issued aspirational flags MUST be REFUSED (Step 2.8); principal-typed aspirational flags MUST be ACCEPTED without refusal ceremony. On ambiguity, default to REFUSE (fail safe). This is a Healthy-Friction negative-contract — friction is mandatory for agent-mode; blocking is principal-elected.
